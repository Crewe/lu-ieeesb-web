				Lakehead University IEEE Student Branch
			</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to the LU-IEEE Student Branch web site. Have a look around. Get involved by sending us your IEEE information in the Members section. Be sure to send in any comments for LU-IEEE and this site.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are a part of the International IEEE organization. Our goal is to create awareness of the IEEE and its benefits to members. Working together members can excel at academic and professional activities, while gaining knowledge of the electrical and electronics engineering industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				The campus club is here to service all members and to represent electrical and software engineering students to the engineering faculty. We also have a library of previous engineering exams and assignments.
			</p>
			
			<h2>
				About IEEE
			</h2>
			<p>
				The IEEE (pronounced Eye-triple-E) is a non-profit, technical professional association of more than 380,000 members in 150 countries. The full name is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through its members, the IEEE is a leading authority in technical areas ranging from computer engineering, biomedical technology and telecommunications, to electric power, aerospace and consumer electronics, among others.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through its technical publishing, conferences and  consensus-based standards activities, the IEEE produces 30 percent of the world's published literature in electrical engineering, computers and control technology, holds annually
				more than 300 major conferences and has nearly 900 active standards with 700 under development.
			</p>
			
			<h2>
				Lakehead IEEE Chapter Constitution
			</h2>
			<p>
				The <a href="downloads/constitution.pdf">branch constitution</a> has been formed and approved at the meeting of February 27, 2009.

			<h2>
				IEEE Code of Ethics
			</h2>
			<p>
				We, the members of the IEEE, in recognition of the importance of our technologies in affecting the quality of life throughout the world, and in accepting a personal obligation to our profession, its members and the communities we serve, do hereby commit ourselves to the highest ethical and professional conduct and agree:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					to accept responsibility in making engineering decisions consistent with the safety, health and welfare of the public, and to disclose promptly factors that might endanger the public or the environment;
				</li>
				<li>
					to avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest whenever possible, and to disclose them to affected parties when they do exist;
				</li>
				<li>
					to be honest and realistic in stating claims or estimates based on available data;
				</li>
				<li>
					to reject bribery in all its forms;
				</li>
				<li>
					to improve the understanding of technology, its appropriate application, and potential consequences;
				</li>
				<li>
					to maintain and improve our technical competence and to undertake technological tasks for others only if qualified by training or experience, or after full disclosure of pertinent limitations;
				</li>

				<li>
					to seek, accept, and offer honest criticism of technical work, to acknowledge and correct errors, and to credit properly the contributions of others;
				</li>
				<li>
					to treat fairly all persons regardless of such factors as race, religion, gender, disability, age, or national origin;
				</li>
				<li>
					to avoid injuring others, their property, reputation, or employment by false or malicious action;
				</li>
				<li>
					to assist colleagues and co-workers in their professional development and to support them in following this code of ethics.
